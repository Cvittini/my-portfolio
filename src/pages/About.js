      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Cristian A. Vittini Hernandez</strong>, I'm a self-taught developer with a front-end foundation, currently expanding into Python scripting, automation, and AI-driven solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into tech is fueled by a love for crafting visually appealing
        and highly functional web applications. I bring a unique blend of design
        sensibility and technical expertise, ensuring that every project I work
        on is not only aesthetically pleasing but also delivers a seamless user
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive in environments where innovation meets practicality, and I love
        turning complex ideas into simple, effective solutions. Outside of
        coding, I enjoy spending quality time with my family and continuously
        exploring new technologies, including AI and Python as part of my growth
        journey.
